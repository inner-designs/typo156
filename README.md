The goal of the program is to compare an input against all entries in a dictionary or list.

This program checks for four specific typos in a word:
1. Adding one letter
2. Removing one letter
3. Substitute one letter
4. Switching two adjacent letters

After checking against the whole dictionary or word list, the program returns 0 if the input
matches an entry, returns 1 if one of the specific typo conditions are true, and returns
2 if the word does not match any entry and does not match the typo conditions.
